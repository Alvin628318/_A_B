        <p id="gamerule">Your goal is to guess a valid 4-digit number that is randomly generated. <br>
            A valid 4-digit number is one that does not have repeating digits. <br>
            For example, "3476" and "0291" is valid while "7550" is not. <br>
            Every time you guess a valid 4-digit number, you will be hinted with the number of correct digits you guessed; <br>
            For every digit that exists within the answer and is located at the same spot, you get 1 A. <br>
            For every digit that exists within the answer but is not located at the same spot, you get 1 B. <br>
            For example, if the answer were to be "1234", guessing "2574" will hint you with "1A1B"; guessing 9705 will hint you with "0A0B". <br>
            Your goal is to use the hints given to you every time you guess a valid 4-digit number to infer and guess the answer. <br>
            If you do so, you will see a "4A0B". This means that you have correctly guessed the randomly generated number. <br>
            You can continue on guessing, and your results will be shown on the left every time you sucessfully guessed an answer. <br>
            Have fun!
